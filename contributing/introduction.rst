**********************************
But What Can I Offer?
**********************************

Your experiences will be both the same as hundreds of others and yet uniquely yours at the same time. Your own unique perspective, combined with your own creativity, coupled with your skills and experience, mean you have something to offer!

See a bug? Know of an improvement, even if it's tiny? Feel free to share about it!

**********************************
I'm Scared! This is my first time!
**********************************

That's completely understandable. We all started with a sense of excitement and fear all at once. Excitement to be a
contributor, and fear that my contribution might be wrong or break something or be rejected. Those are normal
feelings. Here's an `excellent article <https://medium
.com/nybles/tutorial-making-your-first-pull-request-how-to-do-it-b57e7403baaa>`_ explaining those same feelings and
showing how easy it is to get through them!

**********************************
Where do I start?
**********************************

It's really as easy as 1-2-3 ...

    1. Start with reviewing the :doc:`../contributing/issues` document, as a guide to first steps about exploring the
    issue further, checking whether it's already being addressed someplace, whether it's a core bug vs a "bugs-me
    bug", along with how to report the issue to the dev team and community for further discussion using Github Issues or the Zen Cart Support Forum.

    2.If you're simply "looking for ways to get started", take a look at the existing `Zen Cart Issues on Github
    <https://github.com/zencart/zencart/issues>`_ for issues that are tagged with "up-for-grabs" or "first-timers-only".

    3. If you're going to contribute code, read through the :doc:`../contributing/pullrequests`
    document to learn more about setting up git and github, cloning the repository, creating a branch in which to
    make your code changes, and how to submit pull requests.
    As you start working on your code changes and pull request, review the :doc:`../contributing/codingstandards`
    guide to ensure that your code matches both the formatting and testing requirements. If you're submitting a new
    feature and know how to write PHP code tests, please be sure to submit tests with your code, where appropriate.
