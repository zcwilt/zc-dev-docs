Admin Classes
#############

Currently classes that relate solely to admin are mainly stored in the `admin/includes/classes` directory.

In v157+ any new classes will be stored in the `catalog` classes directory under an admin directory.

e.g. `includes/classes/admin/`

.. warning:: For now, we will not accept any pull requests that move current admin classes to the new directory. This
 is to ensure backward compatibilty of plugins. This may change in future Major releases.
